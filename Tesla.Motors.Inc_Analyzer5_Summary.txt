Company Update:

Tesla said Wednesday that it plans to offer 5.3MM shares to start development on the Model X crossover SUV. Tesla is also conducting a private placement. CEO Elon Musk will buy 1.5MM shares for about
$40MM. Also, Daimler AG affiliate Blackstar Investco LLC1 will add to its position with another 577,000 shares, worth about $15.2MM.

Tesla plans to raise about $200MM in capital, including the secondary offering and capital infusion from Musk and Daimler/Blackstar.

Analysis:

The capital raise has been well-communicated, so it comes as no surprise. However, the timing is ahead of expectations. The capital raised will primarily be used to accelerate Model X development. The fact that timing is ahead of schedule speaks to Model S progress. Put simply, Tesla has early stage product development employees who are free to work on Tesla’s next product now that early stage development of the Model S is complete.

Also surprising to us is the private placement, with the CEO investing an incremental $40MM in Tesla, which is a positive development.

Finally, we note that no holders are selling concurrently with the offering, which we think is encouraging.


1 Blackstar Investco LLC is 60% owned by Daimler North America Corporation and 40% owned by Aabar Blackstar Holdings GmbH. It is already an 8% owner of TSLA. Put another way, Daimler is an ~8% owner in TSLA through the Blackstar subsidiary.
